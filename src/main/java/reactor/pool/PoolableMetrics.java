     * This can be useful to do active idle eviction (eg. some loadbalancers will terminate a TCP connection unilaterally after x minutes).

     * The evictionPredicate from the PoolConfig can look at this time even in the release phase, because it MUST be reset
     * to 0L before the application of the recycler function and evictionPredicate itself, so it will always look "fresh".
     *
     * Eviction can happen when an acquire() encounters an available element that is detected as idle.
     * It could then either:
     *   - only remove that element and call the allocator
     * OR
     *   - continuously loop until it finds a valid available element, only calling the allocator when it ends up finding no valid element
     *
     * Another possibility is to use a reaper thread that actively removes idle resources from the available set (but that would need some more synchronization).s
